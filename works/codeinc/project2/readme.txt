works like project 1. Except this time it should kinda work :>

names stay at maximum 128 characters. I went ahead and coded no single error catching functions, so 
pretty plz do not input the biggest name ever registered to someone, else we'll have trouble trouble :>

actual work is named in regular convention; tests.c is some junk i had to do to test if qsort was gonna cut it
or i would need to manually code a sorting algorithm for this.
