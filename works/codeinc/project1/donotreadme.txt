what is this?
	this is where i keep stored any kind of documentation used and needed
	and where i use very very vulgar language to explain how a problem was solved
		or how it went unsolved and i just said "fuckit, it will stay just like
		that".
	Very fun.

	Started the W O R K S. Thing is, people will prolly be stored in a vector with people pointers.
	cars should be like:
	
	person1 - car1, car2, car3, etc..
	person2 - car1, etc...
	etc...

	which means a car will be organized inside a car ***cars vector, which makes me want to kill someone right now :)
