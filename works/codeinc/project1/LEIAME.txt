0. INTRODUCTION -> WHAT DOES THIS DOES?
	this program serves to test basic characteristcs of a db.
	it allows the user to register someone as an owner of a car, getting the necessary info for registration.
	it allows the visualization of the saved data after registering.
	for every new session, the program will overwrite previous saved data.
	It will display the saved data when you finish registering the session's data.
	There is NO way to retrieve the data, as it was not required to complete the assignment.

1. USING THE PROGRAM
	1.1. START
		upon start, you will be presented with two options:
			1. register
			2. exit

		input the number according to the functionality you wish to use.

	1.2. REGISTERING
		Upon selecting to register, the program will ask for information. 
		The buffer size will be set to 128 for all entries, act accordingly.
		The number of people and cars belonging to such people will be based on 
		user's choice. Keep track of your memory for this, eh? It should at most
		use kilobytes of data, but pretty please don't try to register a million
		dudes at once if you wish to have a functioning machine (and fingers) after the execution.
		When finished inputing info, the program should be able to save the data.
		then, it will ask if you wish to input more data or visualize and exit.
		act accordingly.
		After that, you might want to stop, else no data will be saved, most probably.
		The program will display the data and exit upon input.
