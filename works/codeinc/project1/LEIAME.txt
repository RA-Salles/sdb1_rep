warning 1.5: the following vulgar language is used to express very emotionally why you should follow
		the provided instructions with precision. If you feel reasonably confident operating 
		computers, read and use the program. Else, please, close this README file and never ever
		touch this software, as it will, most probably, cause unforeseen consequences. Act with 
		precision and some confidence.
warning 2: THE PROGRAM IS NOT PRODUCTION READY AND IS PROVIDED AS-IS FOR THE USER. PRETTY PLEASE, BEWARE OF FUCKUPS, I'VE WRITEN NO SINGLE LINE OF ERROR PREVENTION.
		FUCKING UP A SELECTION OR SOMETHING !!!WILL!!! CAUSE A SEGMENTATION FAULT AND END THE EXECUTION ABRUPTLY.
		USE AS ADVISED IN THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. IF THE PROGRAM IS COMPILED AND USED, YOU AGREE TO HAVE READ 
		THIS README AND TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.
warning 3: the program was coded and tested in windows 10. It was NOT made for portability and was NOT made with the necessary care to ensure portability 
with the least effort. If you truly want it working, use windows 10 for this one. Else, do a ritual dance and it might just work in your amiga64.
warning 4: this documentation was made to design and predict how the program should work. The proceedures here detailed will NOT work
	on the unfinished version of the code.



0. INTRODUCTION -> WHAT DOES THIS DO?
	this program serves to test basic characteristcs of a db.
	it allows the user to register someone as an owner of a car, getting the necessary info for registration.
	it allows the visualization of the saved data after registering.
	for every new session, the program will overwrite previous saved data.
	It will display the saved data when you finish registering the session's data.
	There is NO way to retrieve the data, as it was not required to complete the assignment.

1. USING THE PROGRAM
	1.1. START
		upon start, you will be presented with two options:
			1. register
			2. exit

		input the number according to the functionality you wish to use.

	1.2. REGISTERING
		Upon selecting to register, the program will ask for information. 
		The buffer size will be set to 128 for most entries, act accordingly.
		The number of people and cars belonging to such people will be based on 
		user's choice. Keep track of your memory for this, eh? It should at most
		use kilobytes of data, but pretty please don't try to register a million
		dudes at once if you wish to have a functioning machine (and fingers) after the execution.
		When finished inputing info, the program should be able to save the data.
		then, it will ask if you wish to input more data or visualize and exit.
		act accordingly.
		After that, you might want to stop, else no data will be saved, most probably.
		The program will display the data and exit upon input.
